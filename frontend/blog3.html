<p>“You do contemplate suicide,” the winner of 28 Olympic medals told a hushed audience at the fourth annual conference of the Kennedy Forum, a behavioral health advocacy group.
    Asked what it takes to become a champion, Phelps, 32, immediately replied, “I think that part is pretty easy – it’s hard work, dedication, not giving up.”
    
    Pressed for more details, the Baltimore native described the moment his coach told his parents he could become an Olympian and he recalled the taste of defeat when losing a race by “less than half a second” at his first Olympics in Sydney in 2000, which meant returning home without a medal.
    “I was always hungry, hungry, and I wanted more,” said Phelps. “I wanted to push myself really to see what my max was.”
    
    The “hardest fall” was after the 2012 Olympics, said Phelps. “I didn’t want to be in the sport anymore … I didn’t want to be alive anymore.”
    
    What that “all-time low” looked like was Phelps sitting alone for “three to five days” in his bedroom, not eating, barely sleeping and “just not wanting to be alive,” he said.
    
    Finally, Phelps knew he needed help.
     he understood  that “it’s OK to not be OK” and that mental illness has a stigma around it and that’s something we still deal with every day,  I think people actually finally understand it is real. People are talking about it and I think this is the only way that it can change.
    
    “That’s the reason why suicide rates are going up – people are afraid to talk and open up,” said Phelps. Today, by sharing his experience he has the chance to reach people and save lives – “and that’s way more powerful,” he said.
    
    “Those moments and those feelings and those emotions for me are light years better than winning the Olympic gold medal,” said Phelps.
    
    “I am extremely thankful that I did not take my life.”</p>
